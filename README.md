## Installation

### Package Control

Sorry, not available - I just can't be bothered to submit to yet another irritating packaging system...

### Manual Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/bossanova808/kodi-log-highlighter/releases)
2. Extract to your Sublime Text Packages folder:
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Sublime Text\Packages\`
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text/Packages/`
   - **Linux**: `~/.config/sublime-text/Packages/`
3. Rename the folder to `Kodi Log Highlighter`
4. Restart Sublime Text
5. **Important:** see [changing colours](https://github.com/bossanova808/kodi-log-highlighter?tab=readme-ov-file#change-colours) below for the colours you'll need to add to you Sublime colour scheme to get the pretty colouring

## Usage

The syntax will automatically apply to files matching the `kodi*.log` pattern. You can also manually select it:

1. Open a Kodi log file
2. Click the syntax selector in the bottom-right corner
3. Select "Kodi Log Highlighter" from the list

## Customization

### Change Colours

I experimented with the SublimeText standard scopes but they are just not really suitable for this sort of thing (where there is no 'syntax' as such and the content is by definition being generated by another app and not by the user in Sublime).  So you have to add some definitions to your chose colour scheme(s).

To customize colours, edit your colour scheme (via `Preferences > Customize Colour Scheme`) and add rules for these scopes:

```json
{
    "rules": [
        {
            "scope": "kodi.header",
            "foreground": "#00AA00"
        },
        {
            "scope": "kodi.hash",
            "foreground": "#00AA00"
        },
        {
            "scope": "kodi.error",
            "foreground": "#FF0000"
        },
        {
            "scope": "kodi.warning",
            "foreground": "#FFFF00"
        },
        {
            "scope": "kodi.info",
            "foreground": "#CCCCCC"
        },
        {
            "scope": "kodi.debug",
            "foreground": "#808080"
        },
        {
            "scope": "kodi.timestamp",
            "foreground": "#808080"
        },
        {
            "scope": "kodi.crashlog.header",
            "foreground": "#FF0000"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Change Settings

To modify settings (like enabling word wrap), go to:
`Preferences > Settings - Syntax Specific`

Available settings:
```json
{
    "word_wrap": false  // Change to true to enable word wrap
}
```
